excerpt: Working in remote environments can be tough, but like anything else it is a learned skill that anyone can acquire with the right training and preparation. Here are some resources to guide you in preparing for the field.

### Let's get started
Glaciologists at all training and career levels work in a variety of environments spanning the globe. Here we provide guidence on training courses and in-the-field tips. See our post about field safety and training here where we cover those topics more in depth. 



and field sites of varying remoteness for wide ranging durations from days to several months. To promote the well-being and safety of researchers and foster accessible and inclusive working environments, there are several considerations that are transferable to glaciologists working all of these environments that are highlighted here. Some components of this safety plan rely heavily on [“Safe Fieldwork Strategies for At-Risk Individuals”] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01328-5) by Demery and Pipkin (2020) published in Nature Ecology & Evolution. 



### Training 
A number of specialized training would be relevant depending on the specific working environment; however, implicit bias and bystander training are strongly encouraged for everyone. For supervisors and instructors, training in mentorship and leadership are extremely beneficial considering many academic researchers and educators are not formally trained in leadership. If researchers are working in a laboratory, knowing what chemicals and potentially dangerous materials are in the space and how to handle them is imperative to safety.  




### Additional safety resources
The [APECS-INTERACT Fieldwork Planning Handbook] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fufJf2MatezXfDsFaE6ESH9R5Q7n99BD/view) discusses several safety considerations relevant for polar field work.  Additional resources related to harassment and handling difficult situations are on p115.
