### What is a Mentor and what do they do?
The role of a mentor is multi-faceted, and the definition can change over time or even person to person.

Just as our students have unique skill sets that should be celebrated and expanded upon, so too must the skills and perspectives of the mentor. When developing their unique methods of mentoring, the mentor must:
* Know their mentees
* Model and guide excellence in research, teaching, and service
* Establish effective communication 
* Demystify graduate school
* Facilitate professional development
* Assiste with finding other mentors
* Model professional responsibility
* Support mental health and well-being

Instead, they set healthy boundaries that recognize that both parties are humans who are likely to fail to meet some expectations, and they put in place a plan for those inevitabilities. Here are some templates for shared expectations documents for the STEM and Social Sciences and for co-mentori
