### A comprehensive guide
GeoGradApp


### Contact prospective advisors before applying 
Visit the websites of individual professors or research groups to find potential openings and information on past projects. Reach out to people you are interested in working with in late-summer early-mid Fall to find out if they have funding. Even if a professor does not currently have funding, they may give you advice on who else to reach out to.


### You have an offer, now what?
Before accepting any graduate position, reach out to your potential advisors, current or past graduate students to find out more about the lab environment. By talking to current or past graduate students candidly, you will be able to decide if that lab is a good fit for you and for your goals.
