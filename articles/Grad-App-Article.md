## **The Graduate School Application Station**
Developed by Trinity University graduates, Malisse Lummus and Asmara Lehrmann, the [Graduate School Application Station] (https://geogradapp.com/) welcomes all who are interested in applying for graduate school in the geosciences. Both Asmara and Malisse noticed how challenging and overwhelming the task of applying to graduate school was and saw the need for a consolidated list of tips and tricks to help others better navigate the application process. One way to create a more diverse and equitable community is by knocking down the barriers to entry, and this website helps do just that for the geosciences.

The Graduate School Application Station leads aspiring geoscientists through a timeline from summer to fall, highlighting the most important aspects of the application process to consider during each period. The website is full of resources as well as encouragement and affirmations to get people through the tough times. Here is the breakdown:
## **Summer (May-August)**
#### Deciding to go to graduate school

Everyone’s career path is different, and not everyone needs to attend graduate school to reach the career goals they have for themselves. This section will get people thinking about what really ignites their passions. 
#### GRE Prep
Though the GRE is fading out of popularity with some universities, others still require their applicants to take it. After checking the requirements of the schools they are interested in, applicants should start thinking about how to study for the exam. The website recommends planning well ahead of time and organizing a study group. There are even links for information about fee waivers. 
#### Constructing a CV
A Curriculum Vitae (CV) may seem like something to worry about later on in the application process, but it is actually something that can come in handy early on. It is important to have a professional CV on hand just in case, and there are plenty of resources and templates for constructing your own.

## **Late Summer-Early Fall**
#### Creating a support system
The application process can be very overwhelming with a lot of emotions to process. It is okay (and highly encouraged) to seek help in dealing with those emotions. We recommend creating a support system and looking into counseling services. Prioritizing your mental health early on will help you succeed when things get tough later.
#### Choosing a program
Some folks will want a traditional Masters degree while others may want a professional Masters degree. If you never knew there was even a difference, the Graduate Application Station has got you covered with a breakdown of the two. Some people will go straight into a PhD program after their undergraduate degree, and that is okay too. The path is different for everyone, and it is recommended that you talk to your advisors to help you decide.
#### Finding an advisor
The advisor is arguably the most important part of a degree program, but finding the right one can be tricky. The Graduate Application Station outlines all of their best advice on where to look and how to gauge who might be best for you.
#### Expressing interest
Once you have made your list of advisors and programs, you will need to express your interest. It can be daunting to reach out! The website has templates and advice for constructing those emails, as well as what to ask about once you have heard back. Visit the websites of individual professors or research groups to find potential openings and information on past projects. Reach out to people you are interested in working with in late-summer early-mid Fall to find out if they have funding. Even if a professor does not currently have funding, they may give you advice on who else to reach out to.

## **Early-Mid Fall**
#### Preparing to apply
Though it may seem simple, getting your “ducks in a row” for applying is an important part of the process. You should make sure that you know all of your due dates, and the Graduate Application Station gives you some tips on how to keep track of it all.
#### Personal statement
There are only two parts to this time period because the personal statement for graduate school is crucial and time consuming. Riddled with “unwritten rules,” mastering the personal statement is no easy feat. Things such as avoiding buzzwords and being patient with your editing will help you through.  

## **Mid-Late Fall**
#### Letters of recommendation
Letters of recommendation can be scary to ask for, but your professors and mentors are generally happy to do it as long as you make it easy for them. Getting together your materials, asking them early, and gently reminding them about deadlines will help your letter writers deliver glowing reviews about your academic performance.
#### Actually applying
You did it! The final step is setting a work schedule, sticking to it, and actually turning in your applications. 

#### You have an offer, now what?
Before accepting any graduate position, reach out to your potential advisors, current or past graduate students to find out more about the lab environment. By talking to current or past graduate students candidly, you will be able to decide if that lab is a good fit for you and for your goals.
